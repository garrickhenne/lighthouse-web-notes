## Breadth first search traversal

- Start with the root node.
- Then move onto the root's children.
- Then move onto those node's children.

Breadth first traversal will always visit the nodes closest to the root node before moving on to the nodes that are farther away.

## Depth first search traversal
We will always be trying to visit the leaf nodes first.

Imagine a person walking around the trees.
